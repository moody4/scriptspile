# Adobe Photoshop

Photoshop scripts are small programs written in JavaScript that can automate tasks in Adobe Photoshop. They provide a way to extend the functionality of Photoshop by allowing users to automate repetitive tasks and customize their workflows. They are typically used to automate tasks such as creating multiple versions of an image, or creating a series of effects on an image.

## How to run scripts

There are several methods for installing scripts into Photoshop. 

#### Option 1 — Install 

1. Copy the `.jsx` file into the Photoshop Scripts directory, which is typically located at:
   - `/Applications/Adobe Photoshop [Version]/Presets/Scripts` on Mac OS, or
   - `C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop [Version]\Presets\Scripts` on Windows. 
2. Once the file is copied into the directory, you can open Photoshop and select `File > Scripts` to locate your script and run it.

#### Option 2 — From Photoshop
You can also run scripts directly from within Photoshop. To do this, select `File > Scripts > Browse`, then browse to the script file and select it. The script will be installed and ready to use.
